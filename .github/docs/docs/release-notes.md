# Release Notes

let's learn a little more about Appium Mobile Actions

## About

This library provides a comprehensive set of actions to automate mobile interactions using **[Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/)** and **Java**. It simplifies the process of performing common gestures, device manipulations, and session management tasks on both **Android** and **iOS** platforms.

All features in this lib are based on actions provided by the **UiAutomator2** (Android) and **XCUITest** (iOS) plugins.

## Motivation

Appium is a popular open-source test automation framework for mobile applications. It allows you to write tests against multiple platforms using the same API. However, Appium's API is low-level and requires a lot of boilerplate code to perform common actions such as scrolling, tapping, and locking devices. This library aims to simplify the process of writing mobile automation tests by providing a high-level API for performing these actions.

Until version 7.6.0 of **[java_client](https://github.com/appium/java-client)** (Appium) it was common to use the TouchAction class to create more complex gestures. As of version 8.0.0, the class has been deprecated.
